Dependencies:
    Python 3.8.10
    numpy

Testing environment Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS


Running:

assignment part a)
    usage is ./python3 FME.py <input file> <output file[optional]>
    
    OR
    
    To test all samples and write to output files, run: bash ./run_FME.sh
    
    
assignment part b)
    usage is ./python3 INT_FME.py <input file> <output file[optional]>
    
    OR
    
    To test all samples and write to output files, run: bash ./run_INT_FME.sh


Sample files should contain coefficient for A and b of Ax <= b
Items in each row are separated by a space, columns are on different lines.
Coefficients of b are on last column.
See sample1.txt, sample2.txt, ... , sample5.txt for given sample system of equations
