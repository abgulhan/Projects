File 'models.py' defines the classes for linear regression - ML and MAP
File 'linear_regression.py' uses the models.py class. It generates the 'data.npz' file with sample data and then reads that file in order to perform linear regression and plot the results.
File 'classification.py' uses the data files in \data\taiji\* and performs classification with Fisher projection.
